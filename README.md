# JavaDiscordSDK
Discord Game SDK Wrapper in Java written by "Jackey's Client" in Kotlin, ported to Java and fixed by nichxlas98.


# How to Use
You'll need to download the project and its entirety, add the .gradle dependencies and repositories to your own project and lastly add the actual package containing the code.

Finally, you can use DiscordRPC.run() to start the SDK. Please keep in mind you'll need your Discord client open as well as your own Discord Developer Application.

You can modify the SDKs information in the DiscordRPC class. Have fun :)
